Simple Simon Game Notes:


Rules:
~ The Challenge:
	- To repeat the never-ending random signals that generate.
	- To win, you must beat the current high score by passing more levels than anyone else has.

~ General Description:
	- Start Button- When clicked, this will begin the game.

~ How To Play: 
	- Press the "START" button in the center of the game, and Simon will give the first signal.
	- Repeat the signal by clicking on the same color.
	- Each time you have repeated a signal, you have passed a round. You get 3 points for each round passed.
	- Simon will then duplicate the first signal, and then add another.
	- Repeat the two signals by pressing the same colors in order of appearance. 
	- Simon will then duplicate the first two signals, and then add a third. 
	- Continue with this process as long as you can to reach the end of the game and be a winner!
	- *IF* you fail to repeat a sequence exactly or if you take **longer than 7 seconds** to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a **Losing Sound**; you have lost and must restart the game to try again.


What I need to do:
- one big box holding the following:
- 4 boxes- pastel red, pastel blue, pastel yellow, pastel green.
	- light up to normal colors when clicked
- click circle in the middle of all 4 buttons
	- "Click to begin"


Extras:
** NO longer than 7 seconds to repeat a signal. **
** Losing Sound - must find/create and upload. **
** Box colors - start as pastel and then brighten up to "normal" color when signal is given OR clicked **
** Set up point counter, adding 3 points to total after round is passed. **


DON'T FORGET!:
- ** MAKE SURE all code is SPACED, NOT TABBED!!!
- ** MAKE SURE no code is commented out, all comments must be descrptions of code (esp if it is difficult to understand why it is there.)
- ** MAKE SURE comments answer the question "Why"
- ** CLEAN UP code throughout exercise! Make sure it is properly indented and spaced. 
- ** MAKE SURE there are curly braces around every control structure body?
- ** MAKE SURE no bugs are showing in console!
- ** MAKE SURE new features can be added and current features can mostlyyyy be deleted, and the code still functions properly.
- ** MAKE SURE code is broken into discrete pieces.
- ** MAKE SURE code is FREE of duplicate code!
- ** MAKE SURE TO COMMIT AND PUSH TO GIT HUB FREQUENTLY!
	~ All comments must explain the following: "Why am I committing this RIGHT NOW, what did I add/delete/change, and why?"!! * BE DESCRIPTIVE *
